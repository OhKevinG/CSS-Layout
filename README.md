# CSS-Layout

Example of how CSS can be used for layout.

# Reflection

This project was fairly straightforward for the most part. I procrastinated a little bit and didn't get to make the page as fancy and responsive as I wanted to. For example I wanted to get the list elements in the nav bar to stay in a certain spot on the page when the viewport is adjusted. Everything else seems to be working well and as expected. Again the mozilla web development website that we have been using is such a great reference and I was able to get all the information I needed from there.

# Development

It is recommended to use the VSCode Live Server extension to run the project.
